The wonderful game of Connect Four!
===================================

Connect Four (also known as Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Four in a Row,
and Four in a Line) is a two-player game in which the players first choose
a color and then take turns dropping their colored discs from the top into
a seven-column, six-row vertically-suspended grid. The pieces fall
straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The
object of the game is to connect four of one's own discs of the same color
next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before one's
opponent can do so. There are many variations on the board size, the most
commonly used being 7×6, followed by 8×7, 9×7, and 10×7.
